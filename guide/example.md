<!-- Summary of statistics/multiple choice questions:
     No need to mention everything. Point out the answers
     which are relevant to readers (students, staff),
     and noteworthy (something very good, very bad etc.)
     When referring to specific choices in the form use *asterisks*
     and write the choice exactly as in the report (from the form).
     Ex. Some questions have *OK* as an answer.
         Do not write *Ok*, *O K* or *ok*
-->
The respondents in general find this course to be *Very good*, and the level of difficulty is rated *OK*. Both the quality of the lectures, and their relevance, is considered *Good* or *Very good*. The difficulty level of the obligatory assignments are by most respondents perceived as *OK* or *High*. The number of obligatory assignments is rated *OK*.


<!-- Summary of free text answers:
     Summarize what a lot of the students are saying.
     Focus on what the students like and how the course can be improved.
-->
Some of the participants feel the course had too many topics, and that it would be a good idea too narrow the focus a bit. Others also expressed there should be more mandatory assignments, and that a more detailed feedback should be given.


<!-- Pick well worded student quotes which are representative:
     If the students have very split opinions,  make sure both/all sides are
     represented. Pick quotes about the course (lectures, assignments, group
     lectures, exam etc.) not about the professor, group lecturer or other
     students.

     Do not correct grammar or translate quotes.
     Sensor names by inserting [the lecturer] or similar.
     Do not include directly mean comments, ad hominem "attacks" etc.
     Ex. This is acceptable:
         The lectures were not that useful to me, I learned more on my own.
         This is not acceptable:
         [The lecturer] is boring and useless.

> The course was very broad and gave a good overview.


> The mandatory assignments were deeply enjoyable and rewarding.


> I would like more detailed feedback on the mandatory assignments.


> The lectures were engaging, particularly by using videos to show applications of the theory from the courses. [...] Not a fan of the final exam with multiple choice questions. Feel it would be a lot better with regular questions.
