# FUI Course evaluation software (fui-kk)
This piece of software was written by and for students in FUI - the student council at the department of informatics, University of Oslo. FUI evaluates all informatics courses every semester for the department. Students are invited to fill out surveys for their courses. The fui-kk software is used to gather, process and distribute data from these surveys. Summaries and statistics are posted online for other students. Lecturers gain access to all of the data for their course. The department gets a written pdf (LaTeX) report.

**PS:** Documentation includes some Norwegian translations for clarity.
 English readers can ignore these.

## User Documentation
Separate documentation for users of this software is avaliable:
* [Course Evaluation coordinator (Undervisningsansvarlig)](./guide/coordinator.md)
* [Report writers (KK-gruppa)](./guide/writers.md)

The rest of this README is more geared towards those who want to understand
or contribute to the code.

## Demonstration
A Work-In-Progress (WIP) demo can be found on github pages:
http://fui.github.io/fui-kk/

Please note that this is missing the default styling of UiO websites.

## Hacking
If you want to test this software, or contribute to the project you can get started like this:
```
git clone git@github.com:fui/fui-kk.git
cd fui-kk
make sample_data
```
You will now have some test data to work with.

## KK Report (pdf)
The makefile is meant as a simple tool to run different parts of the software.

If you need to download reports from nettskjema:
```
make download
```
(Not needed if you're using sample_data)

Generate statistics and plots:
```
make json
make plots
```

Insert markdown files into `./data/<semester>/md`.
Then convert them to latex and put everything together using:
```
make tex
make pdf
```

## Web reports
```
make json
make web
```

## Publish raw data:

### Mount DAV
https://www-dav.mn.uio.no/ifi/livet-rundt-studiene/organisasjoner/fui-kk/kursevaluering/

Finder -> Go -> Connect to Server.

Use script `upload-reports.py` to move html reports to the mounted folder structure.

## Folder structure

### ./data

Reports and survey answers are downloaded to `download/` and sorted into `data/`.
This folder contains *everything*, html reports, json statistics, plots etc. for all semesters.
Note that `downloads` and `data` folders are in `.gitignore` so git doesn't track changes.
This means you can work on the real data in the same project folder as you do development,
you will *not* push confidential content to github.

This is a mirror of the data folder used by FUI, without file contents:

https://github.com/fui/fui-kk-data-structure

### ./src
Python and bash scripts. See Makefile for example usage.

### ./old

`src/old/` contain old scripts which are no longer in use.

### ./misc

`misc/` and `src/misc` contain files that can be ignored.
